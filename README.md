# manage-recipe
a web app that allows users to create, update, delete and find recipes on a flask web app

## An Introduction to the Project

This is an individual project that is aimed to demonstrate learning of Python, Git, Databases and some other choice subjects. 
The app created for the project must have CRUD functionality and a relational database with two relating tables. 
To demonstrate an understanding of Project Management, a kanban board should be used to show that there was a sufficient amount of planning made.
The app must utilise Flask to create a functioning front-end website, a CI server for it to be built and a cloud-based virtual machine for the app to be deployed.
For integration into a Version Control system, GitHub has been chosen with a feature-branch model for development.

For this project, I have made sure that I am able to meet all requirments of the specification and to support this, I have produced the following documentation to display my work. The final product is a recipe library that allows the user to add, view, update, delete and search for recipes. In addition to this, the user can add notes to each recipe after they have cooked them to keep track of culinary skill progress.

## Database Design

The initial vision for the database was to create a table of cuisines that can link to the recipes table and provide drop down options when creating a recipe. To add an extra function to the recipe library, I planned to create a table that stores notes for each recipe.
